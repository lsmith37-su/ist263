            <h2>Personal Information</h2>

            <p>My name is Lilianna Smith, and I am a third-year student at Syracuse University. I recently transferred into the iSchool with a Web Design concentration and a minor in Political Science. Special interests of mine regarding these areas of study include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>AI Ethics</li>
                <li>Motion Design</li>
                <li>Human Centered Design</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At Syracuse I have held Graphic Design positions for the University Union and Live from Studio B. I also served as a peer educator in the Barnes center. During the Spring 2022 semester I am set to work as a Graphic and Web designer for the student magazines The Good Life and Zipped.</p>  
            
            <p>Outside of the classroom you may find me in the forest sketching whatever comes to mind or in the computer lab designing in the Adobe suite. I have a natural curiosity for the world (namely modern technologies, design, and social issues) that often lead me down massive internet rabbit holes. One could say I am a professional web surfer.</p>
