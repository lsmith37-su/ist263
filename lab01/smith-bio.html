    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Lilianna Smith, and I am a third-year student at Syracuse University. I recently transferred into the iSchool with a Web Design concentration and a minor in Political Science. Special interests of mine regarding these areas of study include AI Ethics, Motion Design, and Human Centered Design.  

        At Syracuse I have held Graphic Design positions for the University Union and Live from Studio B. I also served as a peer educator in the Barnes center. During the Spring 2022 semester I am set to work as a Graphic and Web designer for the student magazines The Good Life and Zipped.  
        
        Outside of the classroom you may find me in the forest sketching whatever comes to mind or in the computer lab designing in the Adobe suite. I have a natural curiosity for the world (namely modern technologies, design, and social issues) that often lead me down massive internet rabbit holes. One could say I am a professional web surfer.
