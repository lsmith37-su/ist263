        <h1>Three necessary provisions</h1>
        <h2>The AI centered Bill of rights must contain these three provisions to establish the most basic freedom and privacy standards, the bare minimum.</h2>

                <p>When one is unaware of AI’s influence on their decisions their liberty is jeopardized. If the system is not fully audited or benchmarked, this innate arbitrary restraint put on individuals to make choices within the system could prove to be harmful. As per the Constitution, liberty means freedom from arbitrary and unreasonable restraint upon an individual. The first amendment grants us the right to freedom of expression. These two components of our democracy are jeopardized when AI systems are allowed to go to market unchecked.</p>

                <p>Many workplaces implemented employee surveillance technology (ex: monitoring keystrokes, video surveillance, monitoring biometric markers). The key issue here is that some lawmakers believe these tools to be intrusive, discriminatory, and in some cases illegal. However, because of the lack of legislation regarding AI, these companies continue to release AI-software that affect our work and other aspects of our lives.</p>
