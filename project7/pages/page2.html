                    <p>The EU is the first nation to have implemented the toughest and most expensive privacy law in the world known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Known as the toughest privacy and security law in the world, GDPR must be enforced globally if users are based in the EU. Private and public companies are held to this standard. A policy included in GDPR protects an EU citizen’s “right to be forgotten” or the “right to erasure”. This means that one can request a private company to erase all their personal information. Adopting guidelines like GDPR will be the first step to having a safer and more trustworthy user experience in an AI-driven world.</p>
                    <p>In April 2021, the EU Commission adopted a proposal for a new AI-auding regulation. The framework is based on a risk-based assessment of AI systems through a rigorous auditing process with significant penalties if companies do not adhere to safety standards.</p>

If significant changes are made to the system throughout its lifecycle, the system is required to go through the auditing process periodically.</p>

                    <p>Step 1 involves registering the high-risk system with the EU Commission. The AI system must then undergo a conformity assessment to ensure it complies with all national safety requirements. After all tests have been passed, the system may be registered as a stand-alone AI system in the EU’s database. Once the declaration of conformity has been signed the system can be placed on the market.</p>
