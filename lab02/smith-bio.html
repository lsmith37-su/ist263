        <h1>Lilianna's Biography</h1>
        <h2>Personal Information</h2>

        <p>My name is Lilianna Smith, and I am a third-year student at Syracuse University. I recently transferred into the iSchool with a Web Design concentration and a minor in Political Science. Special interests of mine regarding these areas of study include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>AI Ethics</li>
            <li>Motion Design</li>
            <li>Human Centered Design</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At Syracuse I have held Graphic Design positions for the University Union and Live from Studio B. I also served as a peer educator in the Barnes center. During the Spring 2022 semester I am set to work as a Graphic and Web designer for the student magazines The Good Life and Zipped.</p>  
        
        <p>Outside of the classroom you may find me in the forest sketching whatever comes to mind or in the computer lab designing in the Adobe suite. I have a natural curiosity for the world (namely modern technologies, design, and social issues) that often lead me down massive internet rabbit holes. <strong>One could say I am a professional web surfer.</strong></p>
